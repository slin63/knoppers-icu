knoppers-icu is a programmatically generated photography archive powered by [knoppers.icu.gen](https://github.com/slin63/s3-page-generator). Its pages are generated from an s3 bucket with all my photographs stored on it.

It costs a lot more to purchase a domain name, pay for s3 storage, and put in the labor to make something like this than to just pay for storage in google photos, but I don't care. I mostly like it because I made it and I own it.

It's zippy, looks nice, and doesn't do anything more than I need it to.
