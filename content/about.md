knoppers-icu is a programmatically generated photography archive powered by [knoppers.icu.gen](https://github.com/slin63/s3-page-generator). Its pages are generated from an s3 bucket with all my photographs stored on it.

It's a much cheaper way to store super high-res images than google photos. I mostly like it because I made it and I own it.
